      <p>To address the inevitable consequences of aging on the face and neck region, a SMAS facelift incorporates a surgical technique to flatten creases in the face and neck regions while also adjusting and negating the sagging in the cheeks and jowls. This particular type of facelift addresses the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), which is a thin layer of fibers that cover the anterior face and the neck. A SMAS facelift ranges in cost from $10,000-$15,000.</p>
      <p>To begin the procedure, first, an incision is made starting in the hairline and extending along the ear, behind the ear and into the hair. With the incision made, the skin is then separated from the SMAS and raised off of the facial muscles. Next, the tissue beneath the face is trimmed and then re-holstered higher into the face, creating the desired effect- tighter and “lifted” facial muscles. In some cases, fat deposits can be removed at this point to enhance facial definition further. Then to close the procedure, the skin is trimmed and re-draped.</p>
      <p>Facelifts aim at making the candidate rejuvenate their face for a more youthful look. By "lifting" sagging cheeks and jawline skin, facelifts remove excess skin and tightens underlying tissue and muscle. Used in correcting midface sagging, marionette lines, jowls and double chins.</p>
